INSTALLATION GUIDE:
- File can be run from the IDE - Run file
- File can be run from Jupyter notebook, just copy everything into your notebook
- File can be run as standalone application, for that generated a package using Pyinstaller command:
pyinstaller <file_name>.py --onefile --windowed

HOW TO USE:
- There is a quick guide in-app but here is the brief explanation:
- First go to Start Page and Generate the main file which can be used across the graphs;
- Navigate using top buttons;
- Bar Chart uses a separate file so can be run without creating a main file on the start page;
- You can save data in appropriate format (though gauge chart generates a separate window from where you can copy using Plotly interface buttons).
